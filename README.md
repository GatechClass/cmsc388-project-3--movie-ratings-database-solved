Description

You will be constructing the forms and database-accessing parts of a movie rating website so that users can search for movies and leave reviews for the world to see.

Note: On the slides, we taught you to check if the request.method == ‚ÄòPOST‚Äô and then to check if the form can be validated with if form.validate(). However, using this approach will not allow the error messages to show up.

To get the error messages to show up, use if form.validate_on_submit() to check that the form was submitted and to validate it in one step. This allows you to display any errors that are thrown by the custom or built-in validators from your forms.

Side Note: The OMDB API returns movies and TV shows. You don‚Äôt have to worry about distinguishing between types of media. Just to alleviate any concerns. <img draggable="false" role="img" class="emoji" alt="üôÇ" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/svg/1f642.svg">

Setup

Activate your virtual environment and use pip3 install -r requirements.txt or pip3 install Flask Flask-WTF Flask-PyMongo python-dotenv requests.

The setup involves getting an API key, setting it to an environment variable on your system, and installing the necessary packages.

You must use your API key by setting an environment variable. While it is possible to paste it directly in the code, we strongly advise against doing that, as it is a security hazard. We should not be able to see your API key in your submitted files, but we should be able to run your code with our own API keys.

Setup (OMDb):

1. Navigate to The Open Movie Database website ‚Äî http://www.omdbapi.com/

2. Request an API key and navigate to the email you used to sign up with OMDb, and verify your API key.

3. Using the API key you received in your email, set the environment variable OMDB_API_KEY on your system, so that the MovieClient script executes without error.

Setting permanent environment variables (Unix)

1. If you‚Äôre on macOS Catalina, then you have the zsh shell in your Terminal by default. If you‚Äôre on a Linux distribution, then you mostly likely have bash, but the instructions still apply. To determine which shell you‚Äôre using, use this command: echo ‚Äú$SHELL‚Äù. (If you‚Äôre using fish, you probably know how to set environment variables already)

2. Open the the ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc for modification using your favorite text editor (nano works perfectly fine for this, we‚Äôre adding one line.)

3. Somewhere in the file, preferably at the end so you can easily find it, type export OMDB_API_KEY={your_key_here}, with your own key, without the braces. You don‚Äôt need quotes around the API key. Restart your shell application if you haven‚Äôt already, and your environment variable should be set. You can use the command env | grep ‚ÄúOMDB_API_KEY‚Äù in your shell to check if it is.

4. (Optional) After the project, you can remove the API key from your system by deleting the relevant snippet in ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc.

Setting permanent environment variables (Powershell)

1. Search for ‚Äúenvironment variables‚Äù in the Windows start menu

2. Click on the ‚ÄúEnvironment Variables‚Ä¶‚Äù button

3. Click on the ‚ÄúNew‚Ä¶‚Äù button under ‚ÄúUser Variables for ‚Äù

4. Enter the desired environment variable name (OMDB_API_KEY) under ‚ÄúVariable name‚Äù and your key under ‚ÄúVariable value‚Äù

You must use your API key by setting environment variables. We can‚Äôt enforce it, but please don‚Äôt paste the key into your code.

To create your virtual environment, be in the p3/ directory and use the correct command to create a virtual environment folder named venv. To activate it, use the appropriate command for your system (if you‚Äôre having trouble figuring out how to activate your environment, contact us and include a screenshot of the venv directory structure). Then, to install the necessary packages, run pip3 install -r requirements.txt.

This week we‚Äôll be using the requests, Flask, Flask-WTF, and Flask-PyMongo libraries.

Project

This is the p3/ directory structure

Only modify: app.py and forms.py.

There‚Äôs a README, this document, containing your instructions to complete the project. The images/ folder consists of images used in the README, so it is not anything you have to worry about while implementing your project. requirements.txt contains all of the packages you should have installed (with pip3 install -r requirements.txt).

The flask_app/ directory contains app.py, where all of your view functions and app setup are located, forms.py, containing the two forms you will have to implement, model.py, which provides two classes: Movie and MovieClient, which is how you‚Äôll interact with the OMDb API, a static/ folder consisting of custom CSS (don‚Äôt worry about this), and templates/, consisting of all templates you‚Äôll use for this project.

First, we‚Äôll explain model.py: ‚Äì model.py consists of two classes. One is a Movie class, the other MovieClient. ‚Äì The MovieClient class is instansiated with an API key (don‚Äôt worry about this once you‚Äôve set your environment variable), and it has two methods for you to use: search() takes a search_string that the user entered into the search box on the index page, and it returns a list of Movie objects. If an error occurs, a ValueError will be raised with the error message. ‚Äì retrieve_movie_by_id() takes an imdb_id and returns a Movie object with more data on that particular movie. If an error occurs, a ValueError will be raised with the error message. ‚Äì The Movie class consists of up to 10 attributes. If a detailed movie request is made, then it contains all 10. Otherwise, if just being searched for using MovieClient.search(), it will have the basic 5 attributes (title, year, imdb_id, type, poster_url).

Here‚Äôs what you need to do for this project, file by file: 1. app.py: ‚Äì Set the database and secret keys, so that Mongo works and the CSRF tokens can be generated. ‚Äì Use MongoDB to store the reviews that have been submitted. Not using MongoDB (if you use SQLite or some other database, or the session object), will result in a 0. ‚Äì In query_results(query), you‚Äôll need to use the MovieClient class to search movies matching query. If an error is encountered, the error message should be displayed, and no query results. If the search is successful (list of Movies returned), then display those Movies (the template is taken care of) ‚Äì In movie_detail(movie_id), use the MovieClient class to get a

detailed view of the movie identified by movie_id. If it has a retrieval error, show the error message. If no error, then create the

Hint for MovieReviewForm: You should use a field that allows multi-line input.

Testing

Please make sure you haven‚Äôt modified the template files.

When your current directory is flask_app/, you can simply run the command flask run in your terminal or command line to see your website.

Make sure the index page shows up, and that you can enter queries for movies in the form. If any errors occur while querying, the error message should be shown on the query page. If no errors occurred, we should see a list of movie posters and titles. For exmaple, searching guardians yields 113 results. Then clicking on one of these titles should take us to the detail page. Here we see lots of extra information on the movie in a card at the top, and we should see all the reviews users left below that, and then the form for submitting reviews below that. If the movie detail retrieval fails, the error message for the failure should be displayed, without any of the reviews or the form being displayed.

The navbar header should take you back to the main page, where you can search for more movies.

We will be releasing a demo video within the next couple of days.

Submissions

Assure that you‚Äôve tried out all the different things that could go wrong and that they are behaving appropriately (and the things that are supposed to work, still do).

The directory, along with its contents, should be zipped, not the contents of the directory. In other words, when we unzip your file, we should see the flask_app/ directory. If you have any questions on how to submit, please contact us.

After zipping, submit the zip file to the appropriate Gradescope page. No test results will be shown.

Grading

No test results will be shown when you submit on ELMS.

If you don‚Äôt use MongoDB, you will get a 0 on this project.

Your project will be graded on (1) correctness and (2) robustness. Here are the correctness requirements:

Correctness:

| Requirement | Points | | ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî- | ‚Äî‚Äî | | Secret key set | 5 | | Reviews are shown per movie (unique per movie) | 15 | | Queries are shown when media is searched up | 15 | | Reviews are persisted through app lifetime | 15 | | Reviews are persisted when app is closed and restarted (across multiple lifetimes) | 15 | | Forms have the correct names and validators | 10 | |

Form fields are all rendered, errors are shown when validation fails | 10 | | Validation errors displayed on page when validation fails | 10 | | MovieReviewForm has multi-line input for review | 5 | | Show reviews for movie after form submitted successfully. | 10 | There‚Äôs a total of 110 points.

Robustness:

Refer to the syllabus for the robustness requirement for all projects. The syllabus has been updated recently with this information, since it will be common to all projects.
